# Image-Segmentation-Using-U-Net
This repository contains code for implementing U-Net architecture in TensorFlow / Keras for semantic segmentation tasks. The model is trained on the Oxford-IIIT pet dataset and can be used for segmenting pet images into different classes.

## Overview
This project is based on the U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image segmentation tasks. The implementation utilizes TensorFlow 2 and Keras, providing a flexible and efficient way to build and train deep learning models. <br/>
