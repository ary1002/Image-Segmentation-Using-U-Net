# Image-Segmentation-Using-U-Net
This repository contains code for implementing U-Net architecture in TensorFlow / Keras for semantic segmentation tasks. The model is trained on the Oxford-IIIT pet dataset and can be used for segmenting pet images into different classes.

## Overview
This project is based on the U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image segmentation tasks. The implementation utilizes TensorFlow 2 and Keras, providing a flexible and efficient way to build and train deep learning models.

## Features
U-Net architecture implementation in TensorFlow  / Keras
Training on the Oxford-IIIT pet dataset
Data preprocessing including resizing, augmentation, and normalization
Visualization of training and validation learning curves
Making predictions on sample images from the test dataset

## Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
Matplotlib
NumPy
